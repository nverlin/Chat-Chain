nathan:
	cant escape login, when call menu() should have option to exit program
	for getting password use (from getpass import getpass) getpass('prompt: ') works same as input does not print chars 	to screen
	menu() function should be made to return tuple (privateKeyHexString,userName)

	new function verify_user() - simply check if file exists in login process
	hanlde Error: (bad password, and after saving user) - should be fixed will test to confirm on linux shortly. Uses
	the oc commands to check if the user file exists already

	Do we want to display the business card in the console as well or just say it was saved. (Currently displays in console)

joso:
	remove debug mode
	screen clear wipes out display contacts
	reserved words checking
	add status check
	destroy var in mem
	make update_user_file --> udpate_addressbook (on blockchain)
	if addressbook empty send message stuck
	

mihn:
	fourth node 
	lock down blockchain (no unauthorized writes from rogue scripts)
